To help me create the best content for you, could you please tell me:\n\n1. **What specific area of AI engineering do you want to focus on in your AMA?** (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, etc.)  This will help tailor the content to a relevant audience.\n2. **What kind of questions do you anticipate?**  Knowing this will help me craft a compelling introduction and structure for your AMA.\n3. **Do you prefer a short LinkedIn post announcing the AMA or a longer article outlining your expertise and the AMA details?** This will determine the `content_type` I use in the `content_creation_tool`.\n\nOnce I have this information, I can use the available tools to research relevant content and generate a draft for your approval."}]
